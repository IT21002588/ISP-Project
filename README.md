# IT21002588 - ATM Fraud Prevention System

# Abstract

With ATM fraud threats growing, financial institutions and their clients need to be protected. This is why the ATM Fraud Prevention System is a complete security solution. It is essential to develop sophisticated and reliable solutions to protect the integrity of automated teller machines (ATMs) and uphold the confidence of banking customers considering the expansion of electronic payment methods and the cunning of fraudsters. 

ATMs are particularly vulnerable to fraud because to their frequent location in public areas and availability throughout the day. Thieves have a large window of opportunity to steal cards and PINs as a result. Because most people use their debit cards to use ATMs, debit fraud contributes significantly to the overall increase in ATM fraud. To prevent fraud, banks and ATM operators can implement a variety of security measures such as encryption, two-factor authentication, and fraud prevention software. By implementing these processes, banks and ATM operators can help protect their customers from scammers while also limiting their own losses.

The objective of this project is to develop a multifaceted ATM Fraud Prevention System that makes use of data analytics and state-of-the-art technology to proactively detect, stop, and manage several types of ATM fraud, such as card skimming, card trapping, card cloning, and unauthorized cash withdrawals. To protect ATM transactions and give users a seamless and safe banking experience, the system incorporates several security safeguards and methods.
